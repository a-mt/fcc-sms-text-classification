* [fcc_sms_text_classification.ipynb](fcc_sms_text_classification.ipynb): Create & export model.

* [FastAPI.ipynb](FastAPI.ipynb): Prepare webservice â€” just trying to predict a value with our model.    
  Note that the model & dependencies have been moved to `app/resources/` for better separation between preliminary steps & deployed app.
